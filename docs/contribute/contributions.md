# Contributions

VS Code has many contribution points: <https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points>

`@just-web` will have much less because many of the contribution points are application specific.

Instead, it will have contributions that are generic to all applications:

- commands: fundamental command pattern
- key bindings: keyboard shortcuts
- colors/styles/themes: styling
- validation: ‚ùì general data validation
- i18n/format: i18n and app specific formatting
- views: pages
